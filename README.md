A small game that I hope to keep developing in my spare time. It'll hopefully end up being a basic 3D city builder with a system allowing for areas to be edited individually giving the player more micro control over neighbourhoods and city centers allowing a more complex and setout manangement style as well as deeper customisation in terms of aestetics.

## Project Goals
* To learn and familirise myself with GoDot and GDScript
* To learn more involved game design concepts
* To work on something different from my day Job
* To hopefully making a game that I would enjoy playing

## Project Timeline
I don't really have a set time i want this to be completed in. It is for the moment just a minor side project that im working on.
